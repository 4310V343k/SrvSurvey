# SrvSurvey

SrvSurvey is an independent third-party application for use with [Elite Dangerous](https://www.elitedangerous.com) by [Frontier Developments](https://frontier.co.uk). It provides on-screen assistance when a player is near a planet in the SRV, on foot or in ships. It has 3 main functions:
- **Organic scans:** Track the location of organic scans and the distance required for the next scan.
- **Ground target tracking:** Aiming guidance towards latitude/longitude co-ordinates.
- **Guardian sites:** Track visited areas and the locations of items within Guardin ruins and structures.

The application works by analyzing journal files written by the game when played on a PC, tracking the location of the player at the time of various events. It uses this information to render overlay windows atop the game, updated in real-time as the player moves about. For the most part the application is fully automatic, players need to start the application and then just play the game. It will remain hidden until triggered by events from the game.
